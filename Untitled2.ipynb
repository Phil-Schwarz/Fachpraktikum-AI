      "[{'text': \"'''''A Clash of Kings''''' is the second novel in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', an epic fantasy series by American author George R. R. Martin expected to consist of seven volumes. It was first published on 16 November 1998 in the United Kingdom, although the first United States edition did not follow until February 2, 1999 Like its predecessor, ''A Game of Thrones'', it won the Locus Award (in 1999) for Best Novel and was nominated for the Nebula Award (also in 1999) for best novel. In May 2005 Meisha Merlin released a limited edition of the novel, fully illustrated by John Howe.\\nThe novel has been adapted for television by HBO as the second season of the TV series ''Game of Thrones''.\\n''A Clash of Kings'' is also the name of the first expansion to the ''Game of Thrones'' board game.\", 'meta': {'name': '198_A_Clash_of_Kings.txt'}}, {'text': \"\\n== Plot summary ==\\n''A Clash of Kings'' depicts the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros in civil war, while the Night's Watch mounts a reconnaissance to investigate the mysterious people known as wildlings. Meanwhile, Daenerys Targaryen continues her plan to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms.\", 'meta': {'name': '198_A_Clash_of_Kings.txt'}}, {'text': '\\n===In the Seven Kingdoms===\\nWith King Robert Baratheon dead, his purported son Joffrey and his brothers Renly and Stannis all claim the throne of the Seven Kingdoms. Two regions attempt to secede from the realm: Robb Stark is declared \"King in the North\" while Balon Greyjoy declares himself king of the Iron Islands. The war among these contenders is dubbed the War of the Five Kings.\\nStannis Baratheon, claiming the throne as Robert\\'s eldest brother and therefore heir, is supported by Melisandre, a foreign priestess who believes Stannis to be the reincarnation of Azor Ahai, a messianic figure of her faith. Renly Baratheon has married Margaery Tyrell, the daughter of the wealthy Lord Mace Tyrell, who is supporting Renly\\'s attempt to usurp the throne. Robb sends his mother Catelyn Stark to meet with Renly and Stannis to discuss an alliance against Joffrey\\'s family, the Lannisters, but she is unable to reach an agreement with them. Melisandre uses magic to send a shadow to assassinate Renly; after witnessing Renly\\'s death, Catelyn and Renly\\'s bodyguard Brienne of Tarth flee the scene. Having lost Renly, some of his followers shift their support to Stannis.\\nTyrion Lannister, Joffrey\\'s uncle, arrives at King\\'s Landing as acting Hand of the King, the senior adviser to Joffrey\\'s reign. Whilst jockeying for power against Joffrey\\'s mother, the Queen Regent Cersei, Tyrion improves the defenses of the city. Learning of Renly\\'s death, and knowing that the Tyrells will not support Stannis, Tyrion sends the crown\\'s treasurer Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish to negotiate a marriage alliance between Margaery and Joffrey. Riots break out in the city due to Joffrey\\'s cruelty and food shortages caused by the ongoing war.\\nRobb wins several victories against the Lannisters while Robb\\'s younger brother Bran rules the Northern stronghold of Winterfell in his absence. Robb sends his friend Theon Greyjoy, Balon Greyjoy\\'s son, who grew up as a hostage in Winterfell, to negotiate an alliance between the North and the Iron Islands. Theon betrays Robb and attacks Winterfell, taking the castle and capturing Bran and his younger brother Rickon. When Bran and Rickon escape, Theon fakes their deaths. Believing this ruse, Stark supporters besiege the castle, including a force from the Starks\\' sometime ally House Bolton. However, the Bolton soldiers turn against the Stark and Greyjoy forces alike, burn Winterfell, slaughter its inhabitants, and take Theon prisoner.\\nRobb\\'s sister Arya is taken north posing as a new recruit for the Night\\'s Watch. The recruits are attacked by Lannister forces, and the survivors are taken to the gigantic castle of Harrenhal, which is controlled by Joffrey\\'s grandfather Tywin Lannister, and put to work as servants. For saving his life during the attack, a mysterious man named Jaqen H\\'ghar promises to repay Arya by killing three men of her choice. Arya leverages this offer to help Northern forces retake control of Harrenhal. Jaqen gives Arya a mysterious iron coin and tells her to find him in the foreign city of Braavos if she should ever desire to learn his secrets. Arya soon escapes the castle.\\nStannis\\' army launches assaults on King\\'s Landing by both land and sea in a battle in Blackwater Bay. Under Tyrion\\'s command, the Lannister forces use \"wildfire\" (similar to Greek fire) to ignite the bay, and raise a massive chain across its mouth to prevent Stannis\\' fleet from retreating. Tywin leads his army and the Tyrell forces to the defense of King\\'s Landing, and Stannis\\'s forces are defeated. During the battle, Tyrion is attacked and injured by a knight of Joffrey\\'s Kingsguard; by the time Tyrion regains consciousness after the battle, Tywin has assumed the post of Hand of the King.', 'meta': {'name': '198_A_Clash_of_Kings.txt'}}]\n"

He is known for outliving his many wives (now on his 8th) and siring over 100 children (both bastard and trueborn). Because the use of the Twins became a strategic necessity for Robb\\'s host, Walder was able to negotiate marriage contracts for his children to Robb and Arya Stark. But during Season 2 Robb broke his word and married Lady Talisa. For this slight, and willing to take advantage of the war\\'s changing fortunes, he conspires with Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton to betray Robb Stark at the wedding of his liege Edmure Tully, which he insists in return for support of his men. Frey hosts the infamous \"Red Wedding\" at which Robb Stark, his wife and mother are all murdered, refusing to spare Robb even as Catelyn holds Lady Frey hostage and threatens to slit her throat, which she does. He is subsequently granted Riverrun and its lands (though the title Lord Paramount of the Riverlands passes to Harrenhal and House Baelish) and expresses delight to take another young wife, but his house is irredeemably tarnished by the betrayal and House Tully\\'s vassals refuse to submit to his rule.
