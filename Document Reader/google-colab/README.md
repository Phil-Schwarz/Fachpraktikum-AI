### Short introduction 
There are three subfolders. CosmosQA dataset, OpenBook dataset and RACE dataset. Limited to computational resources, i.e memory and GPU or TPU, fine-tuning are redone in unicluster. In this folder, some experiments with smaller batch size. e.g. batch size = 8 is chosen.
Please refer to each subfolder for more information of experiments on this dataset.
