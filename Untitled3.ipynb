turner first exhibited in description made during the latter years of turner career this painting depicts the aftermath of the great flood story told in the book of genesis the role of man is portrayed as passive through his inability to control nature which is beautiful to the eye yet has the power to destroy and recreate life this piece also illustrates turner belief in god omnipotence as it is he who creates the flood allows noah to survive and inspired moses to write the book of genesis genesis in this case leads back to the creation of man light and the water which light is being reflected on style for most of his career turner whose works are predominantly subjective was recognised for his watercolor and oil paintings that reflected landscape images and scenes of natural entities such as the weather the ocean the effect of light and vision through the blurring of images turner attempts to justify the belief that the eye is always trying to form an image as it tries to recreate nature traditionally colour is used as type of accessory to form but turner attraction to light and colour allows colour to take the place of form the main colours used by turner were red yellow and blue which is discussed more in depth in relation to other works that influenced that of turner his work also illustrates his relationship to the romantic movement and position as the precursor of the impressionist movement goethe theory as expressed in the title of the painting turner found interest in johann wolfgang von goethe book theory of colours also known as zur farbenlehre published in turner absorbed goethe theory of light and darkness and depicted their relationship in number of his paintings according to this theory the creation of colour is dependent on the distribution of dark and light reflecting through transparent object turner uses concepts from goethe theory which is rejection of newton seven color theory and expresses the belief that every colour was an individualised combination of light and darkness newton reasoning in his theory of light and colour was in the words of michael duck too simplistic for goethe as result goethe found his own form of vision in regards to the physiological aspects of the concept of colour as result goethe claims that there is an infinite amount of colour variation and through his paintings turner attempts to reflect this theory turner also responds to the plus and minus concepts that goethe created to address both emotions and the eye his main focus was the afterimage that is left on the retina after seeing an image through this after image the plus addresses the colours red and yellow which is intended to evoke buoyant feelings while the colour blue contrasts such as it creates the emotion of melancholy and desolation according to goethe concept yellow undergoes transition of light becoming darker when light reaches its peak just as the sun shines in the sky it develops to white light that is colourless but the light deepens and evolves the yellow into an orange and then finally to ruby red hue turner illustrates the process of yellow transitioning into phases of light by showing how as the viewer moves away from the centre the edges get darker symbolism the yellow colouring of the painting is reference to goethe theory of colour which explains the colour yellow as being the first colour transmitted from light the form of the painting is circular symbolising the construction of the human eye changing the focus of typical linear splitting of space to more subjective portrayal the colour yellow is typically optimistic but turner captures the negativity of yellow by attaching the colour to light that is subject to change the morning sun aspect of the colour is something transient companion piece turner paired piece titled shade and darkness the evening of the deluge was also exhibited in in this piece as well as the morning after the deluge turner makes no attempt to mirror the scene of the flood in its naturality fallacies of hope is poem that turner supposedly wrote to parallel the two paintings frankfurt theft light and colour was among three paintings stolen
