from ancient times up to the turn of the th century geography the originally greek term okeanos aithiopos is an old name for what is now called the south atlantic ocean it is separated from the north atlantic ocean by narrow region between natal brazil and monrovia liberia the term ethiopian ocean appeared until the mid th century for example on the map accuratissima totius africae in lucem producta engraved by johann baptist homann and frederick de wit and published by jacob von sandrart in nürnberg in the name aethiopian was related to the fact that historically africa west and south of egypt was known as aethiopia nowadays the classical use of the term has become obsolete also the nation of ethiopia then known as abyssinia is located nowhere near its namesake body of water but in the opposite eastern end of africa which is much closer to indian ocean and its subset the red sea oceanus æthiopicus in the map guinea propria nec non nigritiae vel terrae nigorum aethiopia inferior

circle in blue and the july mean isotherm in red the arctic circle is one of the two polar circles and the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of earth it marks the northernmost point at which the center of the noon sun is just visible on the december solstice and the southernmost point at which the center of the midnight sun is just visible on the june solstice the region north of this circle is known as the arctic and the zone just to the south is called the northern temperate zone as seen from the arctic the sun is above the horizon for continuous hours at least once per year and therefore visible at midnight and below the horizon for continuous hours at least once per year and therefore not visible at noon this is also true in the antarctic region south of the equivalent antarctic circle the position of the arctic circle is not fixed and currently runs north of the equator its latitude depends on the earth axial tilt which fluctuates within margin of more than over year period owing to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the moon consequently the arctic circle is currently drifting northwards shrinking at speed of about per year etymology the word arctic comes from the greek word ἀρκτικός arktikos near the bear northern and that from the word ἄρκτος arktos bear midnight sun and polar night relationship of earth axial tilt to the tropical and polar circles at night bright aurora borealis are fairly common sight in the arctic circle the picture of the northern lights in rovaniemi the arctic circle is the southernmost latitude in the northern hemisphere at which the center of the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for twenty four hours as result at least once each year at any location within the arctic circle the center of the sun is visible at local midnight and at least once the center is not visible at local noon directly on the arctic circle these events occur in principle exactly once per year at the june and december solstices respectively however because of atmospheric refraction and mirages and also because the sun appears as disk and not point part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about minutes south of the arctic circle similarly on the day of the northern winter solstice part of the sun may be seen up to about north of the arctic circle that is true at sea level those limits increase with elevation above sea level although in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the true horizon human habitation cylindrical projection showing the arctic circle in red only four million people live north of the arctic circle because of the climate nonetheless some areas have been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples who today make up of the region population the largest communities north of the arctic circle are situated in russia norway and sweden murmansk population norilsk tromsø vorkuta and kiruna rovaniemi in finland is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the arctic circle lying south of the line in contrast the largest north american community north of the arctic circle sisimiut greenland has approximately inhabitants in the united states utqiaġvik alaska is the largest settlement north of the arctic circle with about inhabitants the largest such community in canada is inuvik in the northwest territories with people living there geography the arctic circle is roughly long the area north of the circle is about and covers roughly of earth surface the arctic

russia the united states alaska canada yukon northwest territories and nunavut denmark greenland and iceland where it passes through the small offshore island of grímsey climate the climate inside the arctic circle is generally cold but the coastal areas of norway have generally mild climate as result of the gulf stream which makes the ports of northern norway and northwest russia ice free all year

emilia romagna and the part of mantua lombardy on the right south bank of the po parmigiano is the italian adjective for parma and reggiano that for reggio emilia both parmigiano reggiano and parmesan

full italian name unambiguously referring to pdo parmigiano reggiano it has been called the king of cheeses and practically perfect food production parmigiano reggiano is made from unpasteurised cow milk the whole milk of the morning milking is mixed with the naturally skimmed milk which is made by keeping milk in large shallow tanks to allow the cream to separate of the previous evening milking resulting in part skim mixture this mixture is pumped into copper lined vats which heat evenly and contribute copper ions to the mix copper lined vats for the production of parmigiano reggiano starter whey containing mixture of certain thermophilic lactic acid bacteria is added and the temperature is raised to calf rennet is added and the mixture is left to curdle for minutes the curd is then broken up mechanically into small pieces around the size of rice grains the temperature is then raised to with careful control by the cheese maker the curd is left to settle for minutes the compacted curd is collected in piece of muslin before being divided in two and placed in molds there is of milk per vat producing two cheeses each the curd making up each wheel at this point weighs around the remaining whey in the vat was traditionally used to feed the pigs from which prosciutto di parma cured parma ham was produced the barns for these animals were usually just few metres away from the cheese production rooms cracking open wheel of parmigiano reggiano cheese the cheese is put into stainless steel round form that is pulled tight with spring powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape after day or two the buckle is released and plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the parmigiano reggiano name the plant number and month and year of production is put around the cheese and the metal form is buckled tight again the imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about day and the wheel is then put into brine bath to absorb salt for days after brining the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for months each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be cheeses high by cheeses long or total wheels per aisle each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every seven days the cheese is also turned at this time parmigiano reggiano factory maturation room product process of parmesan cheese at months the consorzio parmigiano reggiano inspects every wheel the cheese is tested by master grader who taps each wheel to identify undesirable cracks and voids within the wheel wheels that pass the test are then heat branded on the rind with the consorzio logo those that do not pass the test used to have their rinds marked with lines or crosses all the way around to inform consumers that they are not getting top quality parmigiano reggiano more recent practices simply have these lesser rinds stripped of all markings traditionally cows are fed only on grass or hay producing grass fed milk only natural whey culture is allowed as starter together with calf rennet the only additive allowed is salt which the cheese absorbs while being submerged for days in brine tanks saturated to near

diameter between and height between the weight will normally be between the outer rind is yellow coloured but there is considerable variability according to how the outside of the cheese has been washed during maturation generally with combination involving crushed tomato ash and or olive oil uses there is wide range of uses for the cheese which varies according to local traditions and the season the delicate flavour of young pecorino toscano can provide an excellent complement to salad based starters as the cheese matures and the flavour strengthens it can be eaten with honey or jam as
